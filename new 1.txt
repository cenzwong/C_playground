Linear List

Dynamical Memory Allocation
malloc(), free(), sizeof() is in the stdlib.h
acquire memory on the Run

int *pt;
pt = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));

free(pt); // to free the memory of the program

Comparision between Static and Dynamic data structure

Static 
- Save memory
- Add, delete, merge need large data movement
- can access directly
- can do the binary search

Dynamic
- Waste memory since more pointer
- add, delete, merge only change pointer
- cannot direct access
- cannot do the bsearch
